# Multi-Agent Screenplay Generation System - Technical Documentation

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Project Description
This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent screenplay generation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create professional-quality screenplays through specialized AI agents. The system uses a collaborative approach where six distinct agents handle different aspects of screenplay creation, from initial creative vision to final formatting.

### 1.2 Core Technologies

### 2.2 Agent Interaction Workflow

#### 2.2.1 Sequential Processing Pipeline
```

    ↓
Director Agent (Creative Vision)
    ↓
Scene Planner Agent (Structure)
    ↓
Character Developer Agent (Characters)

```

#### 2.2.2 State Management System
The system uses a centralized state object that passes through each agent, accumulating information and refinements:

```python
class ScreenplayState(TypedDict):
    # User Inputs

    logline: str
    num_scenes: int
    
    # Agent Outputs
    director_vision: dict
    scene_plan: dict
    characters: dict
    dialogue_scenes: dict
    continuity_review: dict
    formatted_screenplay: dict
    
    # Metadata
    agent_execution_times: dict
